# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-29

- `TraceLog.setPolicy(policy)`: keep by another policy from now on (a device
  preference changing while the vault is open); `policy` is a getter.

- **`trace/`, the trace log** (`docs/vault-format.md` §6.10): what this
  device observed, apart from what was said — `TraceLog` with five
  streams (`envelope`, `wire`, `wire.bytes`, `mediation`, `diag`), each
  line `{ stream, tid, at, event, parent?, mid?, … }`. The one log that
  is deleted from: a `TracePolicy` gives every stream a `keepMs` and a
  `capBytes`, segments rotate at a mebibyte or a day, and `prune()`
  unlinks whole segments by name — never a line — and leaves a `prune`
  line in `diag` when it was the cap that did it. `traceOf(mid)` follows
  `parent` both ways to hand back the whole onion of one message.
  `TRACE_OFF` / `TRACE_NORMAL` / `TRACE_VERBOSE` and `tracePolicy(level)`
  are the presets; `Vault` takes `{ trace?: TracePolicy }` (default
  normal) and exposes `vault.trace`. Scheduling `prune()` is the
  caller's. Never in a snapshot, never laid down by an import.
- `VaultBackend.size(path)`: a file's size without reading it, or null.
  Prune reads names and sizes, never contents. Every backend here has it;
  a backend elsewhere must add it.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-29

The `.estoc` format on its own. Everything here moved out of
`@estoc/agent-core` 0.16 unchanged in behaviour — `VaultBackend` with
`MemoryBackend` and `OpfsBackend`, the layout constants, `SegmentedLog`,
the contact and invitation stores, the message and delivery logs,
`BlobStore`, `snapshotVault` / `importVault`, and `Vault` — with two
changes at the edges:

- `Vault` no longer knows did:peer:4. `Vault.open(backend, { mint })` and
  `Vault.create(backend, { …, mint })` take a `MintDid`:
  `(identity, serviceUri) => { did, … }`, deterministic. `setMediator`,
  `mintPairwise`, `createInvitation` and `peerIdentity` call it and
  record what it returns; the type of what it returns is the vault's
  type parameter (`Vault<M>`). `@estoc/agent-core` binds it to
  `mintPeerDid` (`openVault`, `createVault`, `PeerVault` there).
- `FsBackend`, a folder on disk, moved here from `@estoc/daemon` as
  `@estoc/vault/node`, and now keeps the mode of a file it replaces (a
  keystore made 0600 stays 0600).
