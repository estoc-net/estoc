/**
 * `@estoc/agent-core/v3` — the agent over the version-3 vault, bottom
 * up: the vault opened, created and inspected with the seed's keys
 * (`identity`); the keys in hand for didcomm (`keyring`); the trace of
 * what this runtime observed (`trace`); the line to a mediator and the
 * pickup of what it holds (`link`, `pickup`); the mediation rituals and
 * the reconciliation of recipients (`mediation`); routes, communication
 * DIDs, disclosure and retirement (`dids`). The protocols themselves —
 * message types and shapes — are shared with the package root under
 * `protocol/`.
