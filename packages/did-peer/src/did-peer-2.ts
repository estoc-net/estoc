 * did:peer:2 (numalgo 2) — https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/

 * The document *is* the identifier: every key and every service is encoded into
 * the DID itself, so resolving is decoding — no network, no store, nothing to
 * be out of date. That is also why there is no create endpoint to match
 * `/did/peer/4`: whoever holds the keys assembles the string, and this side
 * only ever reads one somebody else assembled.
 *
 * Mediators are the reason this exists here. An agent behind a mediator names
 * the mediator's DID as its service endpoint, and that DID is usually a
 * did:peer:2 — so without this, a message addressed to such an agent has
 * nowhere to go, and a message *from* one cannot be opened, since unpacking
 * needs the sender's document.
