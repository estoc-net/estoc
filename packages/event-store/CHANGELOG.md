# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **`@estoc/event-store/v3`**: the version-3 event model of
  `docs/replica-model/event-store.md`, built beside version 2 until the
  vault switches over (v3 A02). RFC 8785 canonical JSON — `canonicalize`
  and a `parseStrict` — jsonc-parser's scanner held to RFC 8259 — that
  refuses a duplicate member, an unpaired surrogate, a noncharacter and a
  number outside binary64 (§3.3); the six-field
  envelope `eventId`/`at`/`author`/`type`/`roots`/`data` with
  `validateEvent` and `validateDraft` (§3.4; `roots` are raw DASL CIDs
  from `@estoc/dasl`); `atOf`/`isCanonicalAt` for the one canonical
  millisecond spelling, `compareEvents` for `(at, eventId, author)`
  (§4.2–4.3); the `EventStore` interface (§5); and `Uuidv7Allocator`,
  which mints `eventId` and `at` from one clock sample, keeps mint order
  within a millisecond with a 42-bit counter, and fails with
  `CounterExhausted` rather than wrap or move the timestamp (§4.2). No
  store yet.

- **`reach(roots, get)`**: the walk `reachable` makes, also saying what
  it asked for and did not find — a root, or a link of a reached block
  — under which nothing is known. `reachable` is its `reached`. For a
  caller that must not go on past an absent block: a delivery that
  would otherwise put a partial object on the wire.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-01

- The event model of `docs/event-store.md` §2–§4: envelope validation,
  canonical order, JSON equality, the filter, `EidMinter`.
- `EventStore`, `BlobStore` (§5), `FileStore` (§6) and `LocalEventStore`
  (§7.2) interfaces.
- In-memory stores for all three, and the block functions of the
  `unixfs-v1-2025` profile they are built on.
- Conformance suites `storeSuite` and `blobSuite`.
- The folder of `docs/vault-folder.md`: `VaultBackend` with
  `modified`, the memory, OPFS and Node `fs` backends; the folder
  event, blob and file stores; `FolderLocalEventStore` and
  `LocalOwner` for `local/`; `FolderVault` with extension stores and
  `dispose`. The backend cases run against OPFS in a real browser.
- Interchange (`docs/event-store.md` §10, `docs/vault-folder.md` §10):
  `snapshot`, `exportVault`, `importVault` with an `ImportPolicy` the
  vault supplies, `restoreFolder` (tolerates a `local/` without
  `self.json`), and `zipFiles` / `filesFromZip` for the shape a backup
  travels in.
